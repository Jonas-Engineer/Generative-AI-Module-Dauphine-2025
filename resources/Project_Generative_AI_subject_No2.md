# Development of a Generative AI Application

**Course**: Generative AI  
**University**: Dauphine-PSL University

## Project Description

This project offers you the opportunity to explore and implement your own idea using Large Language Models (LLMs). You are free to choose the type of application you want to develop (web application, mobile app, desktop application, etc.) and the specific use case you want to address. The only requirement is that your project must leverage LLMs in a meaningful way to solve a real-world problem or create an innovative solution.

####  USE CURSOR AS MUCH AS YOU CAN TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE

## Objectives

1. **Project Definition:**
   - Identify a problem or opportunity that can be addressed using LLMs
   - Define clear objectives and expected outcomes
   - Design the application architecture and user experience
   - Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks

2. **Development:**
   - Implement the core functionality of your application
   - Integrate LLM APIs (OpenAI, or other providers)
   - Develop a user-friendly interface
   - Implement any necessary data processing or storage solutions

3. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Test the application with real-world scenarios
   - Document your code and implementation choices

4. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy your application to a suitable platform
   - Ensure it's accessible to users
   - Document deployment and setup instructions

## Requirements

1. Your project must:
   - Use at least one LLM API (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or other providers)
   - Solve a real-world problem or create value
   - Have a functional user interface
   - Be properly documented
   - Be deployed and accessible

2. Technical requirements:
   - Use version control (Git)
   - Include a README with setup and usage instructions

## Getting Started

1. Fill the form to get your OpenAI API key

#### Please only use the following models from OpenAI (the other models, especially GPT-4o or GPT-o1, are too expensive and will result in consuming all the API Credit and ruin my bank account :():

- `gpt-4o-mini` for ChatCompletion
- `text-embedding-3-small` for Embeddings

2. Install the working environment following the guide

`resources\Guide_Setup_Environment.md`

3. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one

4. Fork the course repository into your GitHub account
